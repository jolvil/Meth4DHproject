# Meth4DHproject
The goal of this project is to analyze the usage of plural and singular forms of “you” by the native speakers of Mandarin Chinese and Lithuanian, and to see, if there are any significant differences between them. The data is the discourse completion task where the respondents had to write how they would ask for something in a certain situation.
